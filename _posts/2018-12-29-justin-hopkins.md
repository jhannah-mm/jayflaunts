Justin Hopkins is one of Jay's oldest and dearest friends. He lives in China. But not this
week. Because he flew back to Americatown and announced that we were going to record a podcast
episode. About what? About Jay. dum dum DA DUUUUUM!!!!

Listen as Justin hoists Jay on his own petard. Which is especially uncomfortable since Jay had
his petard surgically enhanced mere days ago and remains on pain management medicine.

Listen as Justin demands answers about Jay's dark and sordid past, dropping out of universities
just to look cool and fleeing South Dakota after uncomfortable interviews with law enforcement.

Listen as Jay stammers through lame excuses for his ongoing heresy and blasphemes against the current
American president.
